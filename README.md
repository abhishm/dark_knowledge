# Dark Knowledge

This repository contains my work of replicating the Geoffrey Hinton's [work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531) on distilling the knowledge from a big ensemble network to a smaller neural network.

## Key points
1. I need to make my own optimizer to replicate the work.
2. You can learn from this work, how can you use `tf.assign` operation to create your own optimizer method using low level tensorflow api.
3. The code is messy and it is written as a single block. I will restructure it.
